    <h1 class="text-xl mb-3 mt-24"> <strong>Question :</strong> What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
    <p> <strong>Answer :</strong> In REST API, REST stands for Representational State Transfer. Its a principle or a way
        to manage and send resources typically as JSON format. It sends a full representation of the resource as a
        agreed upon format over the
        network when that resource's unique identifier is used. Every resouerce has its own unique identifier (URI) It
        makes communication between server/backend and client/frontend easier.
